# UK Self-Employed Tax Calculation API
A simple UK self-employed tax calculation API written in Java and fully tested with JUnit5.
Testing style is mostly BDD which also explains basic use cases. 

The smallest unit for computation is a weekly value. This is informed by the fact that the UK self-employment tax is calculated on a weekly basis. For example, a self-employed NI2 is usually a weekly flat rate. See [self-employment National Insurance rates](https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates). The API is applicable to taxable income up to a limit of Â£150,000 and therefore not applicable to income higher than this threshold. 

## Unit Tests
The test suite for the API can be found in the test [folder](https://github.com/Codeama/TaxCalculationAPI/tree/master/src/test/java/com/bukola).
